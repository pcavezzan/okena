//! Focus Management for Terminal Panes
//!
//! This module provides unified focus management across the application.
//! It maintains a focus stack for restoration after modal dismissal or
//! fullscreen exit, and ensures consistent focus event propagation.
//!
//! FocusManager is the single source of truth for:
//! - Which terminal is focused (current_focus)
//! - Which project is zoomed/focused in the sidebar (focused_project_id)
//! - Whether a terminal is in fullscreen/zoom mode (Fullscreen context + terminal_id)
