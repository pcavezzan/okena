//! Window-scoped operations on `WorkspaceData`.
//!
//! Pure operations that look up or mutate a single targeted window's state
//! by `WindowId`. Each setter routes through the `window_mut` lookup pair so
//! an unknown extra id (e.g. caller raced a close) becomes a silent no-op
//! rather than a panic, absorbing the close-race bookkeeping at the data
//! layer instead of forcing every call site to pre-check existence.
//!
//! These live in their own module per the slice 02 acceptance criterion that
//! a `windows` module exists with the operations listed in the PRD's "Module
//! sketch -> okena-workspace::windows" section. They are inherent methods on
//! `WorkspaceData` rather than free-standing functions because every prior
//! commit on this slice settled on that style and the operations cleanly fit
//! it; the issue's free-standing `fn` signatures are descriptive of shape,
//! not prescriptive of where they live.
